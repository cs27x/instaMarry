# instaMarry

##Description
istaMarry is a social network where people can create and share their ideal partner. Essentially, people find material items they wish their partner owned and share them through the app. This constructs a profile of what kind of person they would date, what that person would wear and what kind of appearance they would present. 
A person can share these items in one of two ways. The easiest is if they find something online they like they can share it to their instaMarry profile. The second way is if they find someone wearing something they like, snap a picture and upload it to instaMarry. Both can be used to create an ideal partner to be shared with friends.
